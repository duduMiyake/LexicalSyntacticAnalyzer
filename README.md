# Lexical and Syntactic Analyzer

# Introduction 
This project provides a Lexical and Syntactic Analyzer that processes input strings into tokens (lexical analysis) and validates the syntactic structure of the token sequence (syntactic analysis) based on a defined grammar.

The grammar used for this analyzer is as follows:
